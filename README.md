## I. Introduction

This project demonstrates how the application of a Business Intelligence (BI) tool, specifically **Microsoft Power BI**, 
can enable users to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and present them through data visualisations and interactive dashboards 
that support data-driven decision-making.

In this project, we apply Power BI to the **World Bank’s Global Findex Database**, 
which contains a wide range of financial inclusion indicators across various countries over time.
